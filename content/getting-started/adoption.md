# Adoption Steps
The Design System is adopted per product across gradual steps in priority order. These steps serve as milestones to track adoption across all products no matter the pace of an individual product team.

# Planning
## Approaches 
Product teams tend to adopt a design system’s UI Component library using one of two approaches:

 - **Big Bang:** Across several sprints, a product team stops all other work to remove an old system and install the Cupcake Design System. This concentrated period slows a product’s work on new features, defects, and optimizations,but it cleanly and quickly applies the Design System so that a product can move forward confident that adoption is complete.
 
 - **Incremental**: Due to existing commitments and competing priorities, a product team may choose to adopt Cupcake over a longer period of time. As such, the team may fold in tasks of replacing existing product features with Cupcake features alongside other work. Adoption steps tied to specific dates or sprints can provide a helpful barometer of intermediate goals and also help teams understand in what order Cupcake features should be adopted.

## Working With the Cupcake Team
When considering adoption, contact the Cupcake team to schedule time to discuss your objectives and approach. This collaborative conversation will help you identify the following for your product’s adoption:

- **Approach**: Will it be a “Big Bang” or “Incremental” adoption of the System?

- **Timing**: When might you start design and engineering work (potentially need more support) and complete the adoption process?

- **Priorities**: What Cupcake features are most relevant to your product? Knowing this will help our team to recommend effective techniques and shortcuts for planning and breaking down the work.

- **Depth** : Not every Cupcake feature may be relevant or feasible to integrate into your product. What are the priorities and/or limitations?

- **Customization**: How can you extend Cupcake to suit your product’s needs, and are any of those extensions relevant for the Cupcake team to support within the library itself?
