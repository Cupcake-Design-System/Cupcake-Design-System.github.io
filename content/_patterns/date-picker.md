## Context of use
The date picker should be available where dates and/or times need to be selected in order to accomplish a task.

## Where used

The date picker is typically used, but not restricted to, for the following:

- to post a form
- to book an event
- to log an action

## How it works

Date pickers will have different features depending on the requirements:

- single month + day + year selection
- date range (month + day + year) selection
- date & time (month + day + year + time) selection
- date + time range (month + day + year + time) selection
- ability to change year easily (not a three screen fiasco like Bootstrap)
- ability to add a date or date range without the aid of a mouse
- text entry must parse multiple text formats ("Aug 15" / "August 15" / "15-aug" / "8/15")
- Optional suggesters (Last 7 days, Last 30 Days, Last 60 Days, Last 90 Days) will be useful
