## Overview
The types of notifications depends on your requirements, but typically include the following:

- Actions performed by other users eg. comments on a shared workflow
- Actions performed by users in another system eg. updates to a shared resource
- Actions performed by the system eg. unavailability of a shared resource

**Note:** Messages that are delivered by the Alerts component (Banner, Box and Toast Alerts) should not be included as notifications. This will lead to confusion and duplication.

## Structure

Notifications should be non-invasive and non-interruptive, therefore are limited to:

- a counter and panel trigger in the header
- a panel where the notifications are read, managed and settings applied

Specific controls are available on hover that allow notifications to be marked as read or removed.


## Settings
Notifications can be configured via a Settings panel. Settings should be kept simple by sticking to on/off switches.

## Email Integration
Notifications can be configured to send the user email summaries and reminders.
