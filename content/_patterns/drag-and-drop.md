## Context of use

- Drag and drop with cards
- Drag and drop with list items
- Drag and drop with widgets

## Best Practices
- All components that the user is able to drag and drop must have **grips on the left side** to indicate 
- All components that the user is able to drag and drop must have **50% opacity** applied when the user is dragging it to the drop zone
- All drop zones should have some sort of **indication** (blue box or list indication)
