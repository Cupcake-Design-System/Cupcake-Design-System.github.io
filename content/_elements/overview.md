<div class="c-header-sm c-m-top-lg">Element Design Process</div>
A new element is added to the Cupcake library after it is cycled through the following design process:

- There is a clear, repeatable need for the element across multiple products
- Designers will discuss guidelines and best practices on how and when to use the element
- Developers will create the element in code and deploy to the Cupcake code package
