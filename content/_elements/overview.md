#### Elements Overview

**What is an element?**

Elements are the foundational building blocks that comprise all user interfaces.

#### Element Design Process

A new element is added to the Cupcake library after it is cycled through the following design process:

- There is a clear, repeatable need for the element across multiple products
- Designers will discuss guidelines and best practices on how and when to use the element
- Developers will create the element in code and deploy to the Cupcake code package

#### Custom Elements

- When to reach out for a custom element
- Expectations for a custom element
- Etc...
