<div class="c-header-sm c-m-top-lg">Element Design Process</div>
A new element is added to the Cupcake library after it is cycled through the following design process:

- There is a clear, repeatable need for the element across multiple products
- Designers will discuss guidelines and best practices on how and when to use the element
- Developers will create the element in code and deploy to the Cupcake code package

<div class="c-header-md">CSS Utilities Overview</div>
<div class="c-header-sm c-m-top-lg">What is an CSS Utility?</div>
The Cupcake Design Systemprovides a set of CSS utility classes that can be used on any element in order to modify the text, element placement or adjust the padding and margin.

Utilities provide the building blocks for layout and handle a range common use cases that help us avoid writing custom styles. When we need to add something like margin or padding padding to an element, rather than adding a new selector specific to that use case, we can use utilities. This helps reduce the number of unique property-value pairs, and helps keep consistent styles across products.
