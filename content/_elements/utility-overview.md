### CSS Utilities Overview

Utilities provide the building blocks for layout and handle a range common use cases that help us avoid writing custom styles. When we need to add something like margin or padding padding to an element, rather than adding a new selector specific to that use case, we can use utilities. This helps reduce the number of unique property-value pairs, and helps keep consistent styles across products.
