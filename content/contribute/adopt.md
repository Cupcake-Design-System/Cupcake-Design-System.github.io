# Adopt

## Install it
Pull out the trusty npm install and use the Design System. Get it into your project and offload the creation and maintenance of these UI building blocks to a shared library.

## Design with it
Use the Design System in your compositions. When your application designs match the Style Guide (and thus the Design System), you make implementing an app-wide consistent UI straightforward and a joy to write.

## Plan for it
Plan for Design System integration. If the Design System has elements in it that will help you go faster, plan on that – it’s an essential Design System goal. If the Design System doesn’t have the elements you need, consider planning in time as a team to help create the part of the Design System that you and everyone could use.

# Share
## Promote it
If you’ve had a good experience with the Design System, share that. You can help your team and other teams have the same benefits you have had. The benefit remains locked up in the Design System until teams know about it and try it out.
## Answer questions
The Design System has a broad and growing surface area. You have had an experience with it that gives you the opportunity to help others. Be ready to help your teammates and others. Jump into #cupcake and answer questions that are brought up. As we share our knowledge, there are more people around to help with us.
## Assist an integration
We’ve made special effort to make the Design System easy to get started with, but the first steps are always the hardest. Sit down and spend some time with someone making their first integration.
