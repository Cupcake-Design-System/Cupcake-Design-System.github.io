# How to Contribute
There are different levels of contribution. Choose a way to contribute that brings out the best in you and is best for the project.

--- 
## Participate in User Interviews
As we create the Design System, we’re always looking for people to take part in our user interviews. We’re usually testing a new feature and always looking to gather ideas you have. Let us know you're available in the Slack channel #cupcake 

## Ask for a feature
Jump on the Github project, and let us know what you need from the Design System. Once we know what you need, we can work with you to make it more helpful to you.

## Report a bug
The Design System is used in many places. We have a hard time keeping our eyes on all of them to keep up with the issues you’re having. If you see something amiss, please report it via a Github issue so we have insight in order to resolve it.

## Offer design direction
Maybe you have a visual, interactive, or code design insight. We’d love to chat about your ideas and see how they might fit and be used to improve the Design System. Join #cupcake or #ux and share.

## Make a Pull Request
There’s a lot of code that has been written, and there’s even more left to write. It’ll be satisfying to take a look at the final product and know that you made your mark on it. Help as big as new components or as small as a typo fix in the docs is helpful and wanted. Become familiar with our Contribute Code guide, and push some bits.

## Contribute to the design group
The design group meets together regularly to review the Style Guide and the latest designs. The Design System is impacted by all these discussions and decisions. Bring your best ideas and share them.
